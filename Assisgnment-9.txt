function OuterFunction() {
  var outerVariable = 100;
  function InnerFunction() {
    alert(outerVariable); 
  }
  return InnerFunction;
}
var innerFunc = OuterFunction();
innerFunc();

1. Carefully observe this example.
a) Is the InnerFunction() a closure?
b) What is output of this program

A) Answer The InnerFunction() is closure becaues outerVariable accesing in the innerFunction
B) Answer 100

2. What is the difference between a closure and a scope ?

    closure                      v/s                  scope

   a. Accesing the outer function          a.Depend upon the Type of (const,var,let)
   variable in the inner function           const:Can't acces outside method And Can't modifiy
                                            Var  : Acceses outside the method
										    let  : Can't acces outside method
										 
										 
3. What is a lexical scope and how is it related to closure?

   lexical scope:is that accesing the variables from outerscope
   closure:is that accesing the lexical scope
   
4. Output of following closure ?
	for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
	setTimeout(function log() {
	console.log(i); // What is logged?
	}, 1000);
	}
	
	Output
			3
			3
			3
			
			Bascialy we are calling async method,usally asynchourn method goes to queue(event loop,check the call stack until empyt)
			then queue will execute,When the method in queue the 'i' will become 3,from the current value we are excuting.
